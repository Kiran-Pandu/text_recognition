# text_recognition project

A new Flutter project.
Text recognition refers to the process of automatically recognizing text in images or videos and converting it into machine-readable text. Flutter is a popular open-source mobile app development framework that allows developers to build high-quality, cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase.

Flutter provides a built-in library for text recognition called firebase_ml_vision, which allows developers to integrate text recognition capabilities into their Flutter applications with ease. This library uses Google's Firebase ML Kit, a powerful machine learning platform that provides APIs for text recognition, image labeling, and other machine learning tasks.
